```js
// Load dependency
const solr = require('solr-client');

// Create a client
const client = solr.createClient();

// Add a new document
client.add({ id : 12, title_t : 'Hello' },function(err,obj){
   if (err) {
      console.log(err);
   } else {
      console.log('Solr response:', obj);
   }
});
```

## Roadmap

### v0.3.x - v0.x.x

- Implement all features available in Solr 4 (SolrCloud API in particular)
- Provide all low-level commands
- Complete documentation

### v1.0.x

- First stable version
- the API is frozen until v2.0.x, only new features and bug fixes can be introduced

## Test

Tests are executed against a Solr instance in a Docker container. 

To execute them on latest supported Solr version, run:

```shell
npm run solr:current:start
npm run test:current
```

If you want to execute them on oldest Solr version supported, run:

```shell
npm run solr:legacy:start
npm run test:legacy
```

## Test coverage

Before to be able to run the command below, you will need to install jscoverage available 
[here](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage).

```
npm run-script test-cov
```

This command will generate a file named `coverage.html`, use your browser to visualize it.

## Static analysis and complexity report
