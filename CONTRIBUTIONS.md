# CONTRIBUTIONS

The library lives and prospers thanks to you. If you want to share some of your work, or if you have fixed some of the 
open issues, send a pull request with your code and the tests for it.

We're currently re-organizing the project organization, and as such we're starting to adopt a stricter commit guideline,
 very much inspired from that of [AngularJS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit)

So we ask you to respect 2 rules: 
1. Provide the code, the tests, all respecting the style guide
2. Follow AngularJS commit style-guide that can, at the most minimum, be summarized by a single line like:
 `feat(solrCloud): Add ability to query pivot per field`
 
Note: Please restrain from committing code that does other changes than what they are committed for. Avoid changing the 
style guide of entire files while committing fixes or features.

*Thanks in advance for your support in making the library live.*
